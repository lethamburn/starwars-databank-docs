## Example

```text /GET/
GET https://starwars-databank-server.vercel.app/api/v1/characters
```

```json
{
  "info": {
    "total": 952,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "next": "/api/v1/characters?page=2&limit=10",
    "prev": null
  },
  "data": [...]
}
```

You can access different pages with the page parameter. If you don't specify any page, the first page will be shown.

You can also specify the limit number, receiving the number of items that you need. For example, in order to access page 10 and a limit of 3 items per page add ?page=10&limit=3 to the end of the URL.

```text /GET/
GET https://starwars-databank-server.vercel.app/api/v1/characters?page=10&limit=3
```

```json

    "total": 952,

    "limit": 3,
    "next": "/api/v1/characters?page=11&limit=3",
